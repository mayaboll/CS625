Another tutorial file
Could copy-paste text/code in here or upload already existing file

new edit -> pull changes back to local machine
successfully pulled to local machine -> push this edit back to main GitHub

revert to previous version:
working out of local machine, editing files, commit changes
this line is a mistake, after committing, revert back to previous version
